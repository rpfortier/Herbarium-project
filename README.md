# Trait changes in individual trees through time
Contact: Riley P. Fortier (fortier.riley@gmail.com)

This repository contains code and associated data to analyze changes in the functional traits of individual trees across 40 years of climate change. 
A manuscript is currently in preperation (Fortier et. al in review).
